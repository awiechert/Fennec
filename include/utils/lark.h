 *	\brief Linear Algebra Residual Kernels
 *	\details	The functions contained within are designed to solve generic linear and
				non-linear square systems of equations given a function argument and
				data from the user. Optionally, the user can also provide a function to
				return a preconditioning result that will be applied to the system.
 
				Having the user define how the preconditioning is carried out provides
				two major advantages: (1) we do not need to store and large, sparse
				preconditioning matrices and instead only store the preconditioned
				vector result and (2) this allows the user to use any kind of preconditioner
				they see fit for their problem.
 
				The Arnoldi function is typically not called by the user, but can be if
				desired. It accepts the function arguments and a residual vector to form
				an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace using the Modified Gram-Schmidt
				process (aka Arnoldi Iteration). This function is called by GMRES to iteratively
				solve a linear system of equations. Note that you can use this function to
				directly solve the linear system as long as that system is not too large.
				Construction of the basis is expensive, which is why this is used as a sub-function
				of an iterative method.
 
				The Restarted GMRES function will accept function arguments for a linear system
				and attempt to solve said system iteratively by constructing an orthonormal
				basis from the Krylov function. Note that this GMRES function does support
				restarting and will use restarting by default if the linear system is too
				large.
 
				Also included is a GMRES algorithm without restarting. This will directly solve
				the linear system within residual tolerance using a Full Orthogonal basis set
				of that system. It is equivalent to calling the Krylov method with the k parameter
				equal to N (i.e. the number of equations). This method is nick-named the Full
				Othogonalization Method (FOM), although the true FOM algorithm in literature is
				slightly different.
 
				The PJFNK function will accept function arguments for a square, non-linear
				system of equations and attempt to solve it iteratively using both the
				GMRES and Krylov functions with Newton's method to convert the non-linear
				system into a linear system.
 
				Also built here is a PCG implementation for solving symmetric linear systems.
				Can also be called by PJFNK if we know that the linear system (i.e. the
				Jacobian) is symmetric. This algorithm is significantly more efficient
				than GMRES, but is only valid if the system of equations is symmetric.
 
				Other linear solvers implemented in this work are the BiCGSTAB and CGS algorithms
				for non-symmetric, positive definite matrices. These algorithms are significantly
				more computationally efficient than GMRES or FOM. However, they can both break down
				if the linear system is poorly conditioned. In general, you only want to use these
				methods if you have preconditioning available and your linear system is very, very
				large. Otherwise, you will be better suited to using GMRES or FOM.
 
				There is also an implementation of the Generalized Conjugate Residual (GCR) method
				with and without restarting. This is a GMRES-like method that should give the
				exact solution within N iterations, where N is the original size of the matrix. Built
				ontop of the GCR method is a GMRESR (or GMRES Recursive) algorithm that uses GCR as
				the base method and performs GMRESRP iterations as a preconditioner at each iteration
				of GCR. This is the only linear solver that has built-in preconditioning. As a result,
				it may be slower than other algorithms for simple problems, but generally will have
				much better convergence behavior and will almost always give better residual reduction,
				even for hard to solve problems.
 
				We have also developed a novel/experimental iterative method based on the idea of 
				recursively preconditioning a Krylov Subspace with more Krylov Subspaces. We have 
				called with algorithm the Krylov Multi-Space (KMS) method. This algorithm is based on
				publications from Vorst and Vuik (1991) and Saad (1993). The idea is too use the FGMRES
				algorithm developed by Saad (1993) and precondition it with more FGMRES steps, i.e., 
				nesting the iterations as Vorst and Vuik (1991) had proposed. In this way, we have 
				created a generalized Krylov Subspace method that has it's own variable preconditioner
				that can be adjusted depending on the user's desired complexity and convergence rate. 
				If the levels of recursion requested is zero, then this algorithm is exactly equal to
				GMRES with right preconditioning. If the level is one, then it is FGMRES with a GMRES
				preconditioner. However, we allow the levels of recursion to reach up to 5, thus allowing
				us to precondition the preconitioners with more GMRES steps. This can result is significantly
				faster convergence rates, but is typically only necessary for very large or difficult
				to solve problems.
 
				NOTE: There are three GMRES implementations: (i) gmresLP, (ii) fom, and
				(iii) gmresRP. GMRESLP is a restarted GMRES implementation that is left
				preconditioned and only checks the residual on the outer loops. This may
				be less efficient than GMRESRP, which can check both outer and inner loop
				residuals. However, GMRESRP has to use right preconditioning, which also
				slightly changes the convergence behavior of the linear system. GMRES with
				left preconditioning and without restarting will just build the full
				subspace by default, thus solving the system exactly, but may require too
				much memory. You can do a GMRESRP unrestarted by specifying that the
				restart parameter be equal to the size of the problem.
 
				Basic Implementation Details: 
				-----------------------------
				Linear Solvers -> Solve Ax=b for x \n
				Non-Linear Solvers -> Solve F(x)=0 for x \n
				All implementations require system size to be 2 or greater
