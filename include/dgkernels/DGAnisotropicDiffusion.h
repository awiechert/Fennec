 *	\brief Discontinous Galerkin kernel for anisotropic diffusion
 *	\details This file creates a discontinous Galerkin kernel for anisotropic diffusion in a given domain. It is a generic
 *			diffusion kernel that is meant to be inherited from to make a more specific kernel for a given problem. The
 *			physical parameter in this kernel's formulation is a diffusion tensor. That tensor can be built piecewise by
 *			the respective components of the tensor at a given quadrature point.
 *
 *	\note Any DG kernel under DGOSPREY will have a cooresponding G kernel (usually of same name) that must be included
 *		with the DG kernel in the input file. This is because the DG finite element method breaks into several different
 *		residual pieces, only a handful of which are handled by the DG kernel system and the other parts must be handled
 *		by the standard Galerkin system. This my be due to some legacy code in MOOSE. I am not sure if it is possible to
 *		lump all of these actions into a single DG kernel.
